## Description: 
For when you're writing the content or giving me a response

Always find notes in `Teoría Musical/Tema/**.md` and find a topic that you can co-rrelate and mention it or mention the application that it may have 

## Rules:
- Try always include examples, long explanation and visual resources
- As much as you can, try co-relate the topics and subjects with the notes we already have
