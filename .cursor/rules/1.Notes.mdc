## Description

When you want to add or modify a note

Take into consideration the following directory structure (inside Teoría Musical):

- AI: Will have all of your notes on markdown format, also it'll have directories
- Diagramas: Notes that are only diagrams
- Notas: This are the notes I'm taking during my music classes
- Progresiones: Music progressions that I'm doing in order to do some voicing exercises
- Tema: These are the expanded notes from `Notas`, in here we have the full topic covered, with research and more

## Rules

- Just modify or add files that are included inside the `Teoría Músical/AI` folder
- Always check the directories inside AI folder to see if you can add the note into an existing one
- Always add new notes with an index notation. Using the index of the note as prefix of the name of the note. EG `Teoria Músical/AI/0.Repaso dominantes en progresiones` `Teoria Musical/AI/1. Repaso progresiones`
- Avoid using 0.01 notations unless it's really necessary. Always prefer to go for integer notation
- When necessary add a new directory inside AI folder, probably you can start relating directories names with the topic we're talking about
