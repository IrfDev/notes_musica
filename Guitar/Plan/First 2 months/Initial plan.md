# Recommendations

**Additional Recommendations:**

- Practice regularly for 1 hour each day, focusing on the exercises and songs outlined above.
- Use apps (e.g., Guitar Pro, Fender Play) to support your practice, especially when it comes to transcribing or analyzing music.
- Consider working with a mentor or online instructor to help refine your technique and provide personalized feedback.

**Progress Tracking:**

To ensure progress and stay motivated, I recommend:

- Recording yourself playing each song or exercise every week
- Setting specific goals for each week's practice session (e.g., mastering a new chord progression)
- Keeping a journal to track your progress, note challenges, and reflect on lessons learned
