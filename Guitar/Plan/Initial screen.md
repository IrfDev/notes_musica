3. **Can you play a simple melody** : Can you fingerpick or strum a simple song like "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star" or "Mary Had a Little Lamb"?

	1. Practice different parts, starting playing slow until I feel comfortable with the pace, then I start increasing the rythm until I reach the desired rythm.
